## Filing an issue
When filing an issue on the EdEHR project, please provide these details:

A comprehensive list of steps to reproduce the issue.
What you're expecting to happen compared with what's actually happening.
Screenshots demonstrating the bug.

Please remember to format code using triple backticks (`) so that it is neatly formatted when the issue is posted.

Any issue that is open for 14 days without actionable information or activity will be marked as "stalled" and then closed. Stalled issues can be re-opened if the information requested is provided.

## Pull requests
We gladly accept pull requests to add documentation, fix bugs and, in some circumstances, add new features to the EdEHR.

Here's a quick guide:
1. Fork the repo.
2. Create new branch then make changes and add tests for your changes.
3. Push to your fork and submit a pull request. If the changes will apply cleanly to the latest stable branches and master branch, you will only need to submit one pull request. We may suggest some changes or improvements or alternatives.
4. At this point you're waiting on us. There is no formal team managing this repo, although the original developer has expressed interest in some maintenance post-contract. 

## Pull request guidelines
- Each individual commit should make sense by itself as far as possible.
- Breaking up a large change into smaller (coherent) commits is encouraged.
- Good commit messages are also encouraged. Here are some resources on writing good commit messages:

  - [An often-cited post] (http://tbaggery.com/2008/04/19/a-note-about-git-commit-messages.html)
- Update the documentation, examples elsewhere, guides, whatever is affected by your contribution.
