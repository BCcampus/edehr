EdEHR Highlights from 2020

Our Educational Electronic Health Record (EdEHR) received a lot of attention this year. Here are some highlights of what we accomplished together.
We improved the whole case study (seed) editing experience.  This feature includes exporting and importing copies of case studies. It works with the new Files feature described below too.

We added several new starting assignments and seeds  based on the open text-book "Health Case Studies - Toward Closing the Healthcare Communication Gap" by: Glynda Rees, Rob Kruger, Janet Morrison.

In March 2020, the EdEHR made its first appearance in the classroom when over 200 students, with no prior training, were able to complete an assignment during the class.  The overwhelming message was that the EdEHR was easy to use and understand.  This is thanks to all the work we’ve done together.
We used Willo Labs https://www.willolabs.com/ to make "digital learning a zero step process".  Willo Labs provided the necessary privacy between the learning institution's LMS and EdEHR.

We added a new Wound and Skin Assessment module, complete with demonstration course assignment seed.  This new module illustrated how easy it is for health professionals to extend the EdEHR with authentic and accurate health recording processes.  It also shows how the EdEHR can model contemporary provincial medical best practices.

We added the ability to import medical images and files and to use these within the EHR records.  This allows for case studies to include laboratory and test results as well as medical imagery.

We are in the process of adding support for digital signatures. As the student completes the assignment they will "digitally sign" their work, just as in the real world when medical practitioners need to “sign” their work.

Medications!  We worked together to improve the medication orders, scheduling and administration record keeping.  We added a lookup that operates on the Canadian medication database.   This area of the application is looking forward to further work to enhance the database lookup feature and more accurately reflect the pharmacy experience.
To the Vital Signs module, we added Central Venous Pressure CVP to the list of parameters recorded and we improved drawing.
We developed a demonstration mode.  Now, anyone can see how the EdEHR works allowing people to try out the role of student, instructor and courseware designer.  It is a fully functional EdEHR and includes the ability to use medical imagery and reports as well as import and export case seeds.  It was an essential addition to allow us to add the new Wound and Skin Assessment module and it has made doing development so much easier, thereby saving countless hours.  In hindsight, it would’ve been good to have built this into the first prototypes. 
We developed a new home page for https://edehr.org to describe and promote all the great features we've put into the EdEHR.
We added support for mobile devices.  EdEHR works on iPad like tablets and iPhone like smart phones.  Of course, it’s not easy on the smaller devices but it is sufficient to make little adjustments or to view the content of a case.
We added EdEHR branding, including a new icon.  There is lots of room for improvement here but it’ll carry us for now until more funding comes in.
We reworked how the individual pages load and how the application manages user authentication.  This work supports all the different ways we come to use the EdEHR.  For example, as a student, as an instructor, as a course ware designer, as an expert in some aspect of medical record keeping, as a system administrator, and more roles. On top of this the new demonstration mode effectively doubles the types of roles the EdEHR needs to manage.

We made many improvements to assist instructors manage their active assignments. For example, instructors can now close any assignment and prevent further student submissions. Or reopen the assignment if needed. They can send the assignment back to the student to add more work or to see the assessment given by the instructor.  The class list, assignment and seed pages were also redesigned to be useful on mobile devices.
We added a lot of behind-the-scenes improvements including lots of unit tests.  This out-of-sight work is essential to building a robust service that is ready to scale up and support many institutions and thousands of students.

We added database management and security.

Many thanks to the significant funding from BCIT as well as support from BCcampus and UBC.

What is next?
BCcampus continues to offer funding to see more pilots of the EdEHR in BC classrooms.  Please reach out to Bryan soon if you have any possibility of adding this to your courses. 

The demonstration mode remains hidden behind a small checkbox located at the bottom of the home page.  We need simple user registration before we can enable it for everyone.  Bryan is working on a new open source project that will provide user authentication without passwords!
