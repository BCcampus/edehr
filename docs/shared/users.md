# Types of users and their permissions

## LMS administrator
A LMS admin will configure courses and students in the LMS, and link LMS and LTI connections to the EdEHR.

## EdEHR administrator
EdEHR admins install and run the EdEHR on a server for instructors and students to access the application. They provide the tool URL (also called an API URL) as well as a consumer key and secret to the LMS Admin to link the chosen LMS with the EdEHR.

## Course designer
Course designers create or find case studies relevant to the curriculum, put together an assignment based on that case study and create the seed that students will interact with when they login to the EdEHR to complete the respective assignment. They also connect the LMS to the EdEHR through an LTI connection.

## Instructor
Instructors and teacher assistants. Both have equal access to manage student's assignments and evaluation functionality in the EdHER.

## Student
Students only have access to the EHR portion of the application. Students do not have a dashboard to manage their assignments or evaluation notes.
