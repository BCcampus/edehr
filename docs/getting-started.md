# Getting started

After installing your chosen LMS, and installing and running the EdEHR on your server, complete the following four steps to get the EdEHR configured for use in your classroom.


1. Connect the LMS to the EdEHR.
    1. a LMS administrator creates a LTI link to the EdEHR. See [LMS Admin](/lms-admin/) 
    1. then, also in the LMS, a course designer uses this link one or more times to set up activities in courses. See [course designer](/course-designer)

2. Next an instructor or course designer clicks on the LMS course/activity link and will be taken to the EdEHR dashboard. It is necessary for the user to configure the activity and assignment in the EdEHR. See [course designer](/course/designer/)

3. Now the course students can click on the LMS course/activity and they will be taken directly to the EHR part of the EdEHR. The medical student will read instructions that come from the LMS and the assignment created in the EdEHR and complete their assigned task. When they are done they submit their work for evaluation. See [student](/student/)

4. Instructors also get to the EdEHR via the same LMS course/activity link but they come to the EdEHR dashboard with a list of all the courses they have used. Under each course is a list of activities and these each contain class lists. From here the instructor can enter the EHR and evaluation each student's work. These evaluations notes can later be exported to a file and imported into the LMS. See [instructor](/instructor/)

To help explain all this we have a video in two parts. [part1](https://www.dropbox.com/s/j1ycyvb91ef7hcf/tutorial-part1.mp4?dl=0) and [part 2](https://www.dropbox.com/s/duznqu7rz930v1p/tutorial-part2.mp4?dl=0)
These videos demonstrate all of the above including how a student completes their assignment and instructor evaluates the work. You see this in part 2.


## Installation and Development

This documentation assumes you have a running LMS. It is beyond the scope of this project to describe how this is done. Yet see how to setup the LMS to use the EdEHR [here](/lms-admin/).

To set up and install a copy of the EdEHR see [developer](/developer/).
