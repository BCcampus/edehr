## EHR 'Inside' Entity relationship diagram
The schema on the left reflects what a professional EHR schema might look like.  It illustrates only a few tables of a professional EHR that could have 100's or even 1,000's of tables.

Because the EdEHR tracks only one small encounter, all of the EHR data can be stored in a single structured text file. Incremental deltas (version control) can then be stored for each stage of the scripted assignment
