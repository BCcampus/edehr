# Student users of the EdEHR

> This work-in-progress content for a help document dedicated to the student user.

## Getting Started

## Navigation

## EdEHR is a Prototype

This means you will see somethings that just aren't done. For example, many of the EHR pages, such as Laboratory Results contain links to files (x-rays, etc).  These files are always the same no matter what case study you are working in.  That is because the ability to configure those files is not yet developed.

## Scratch Pad

You can use the private scratch pad, if you want to take notes as you research a patient's status. The text you see here is visible only to you. 

## Assignment Details

The Assignment Details button will show you information about the assigned activity. This information comes from both your learning management system and the assignment your instructor or institution created.

Look for instructions and additional resources here.

## Send for Evaluation
When you have completed the work assigned to you then presss the 'Send for Evaluation' button. This will allow your instructor to view and evaluate your work.

## Activity Closed

You instructor may close off the assignment for any further work. When this happens the Send for Evaluation button will disappear and you will see a message banner across the top of the screen.

## Evaluation

When your instructor has finished evaluating your work they may enable you to see their comments in the EdEHR.
