> Placeholder readme file for documentation for student users

The EHR simulates the interaction a nurse, doctor, pharmacist or other medical practitioner would have using a professional EHR. Students will have been given an assignment to complete within the EHR.  The student can reenter the application any number of times to complete the assignment and they can make edits until they submit their work.  After this they can only view their work.  At this point the instructor can evaluate the student's work and leave comments.
