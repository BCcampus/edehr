> Course designer configures the activity and assignment in the EdEHR

### Prerequisite
- a course designer has configured an activity in the LMS that links to the EdEHR. See [previous step](/course-designer/cd-lms.md)

## Course activity list
As a course designer (instructor or LMS administrator) click on the LMS activity previously created. You will be taken to the EdEHR dashboard. The Dashboard shows all courses the current user has activated by visiting the EdEHR via the LMS. See [Faq - activation](/shared/faq.md#activation).


Each course has a list of Activities. The Activity has a class list. This shows the student users who have visited the EdEHR. See [instructor](/instructor/) for more information about the Dashboard.

As a course designer notice:

> LMS description: 

Any activity description the LMS course designer added to the activity will appear here. The description may include line feeds for formating the description and URLs to resources. The EdEHR will automatically convert these URLs into hyperlinks for you to use. This description is also presented to the student inside the EHR. 

> LMS configuration: assignment=ErinJonesCase1

The LMS configuration shows the [External Id](/shared/definitions.md#external-id) set by the LMS admin into the LTI tool link.z You really only need this if you need to trace this EdEHR assignment back to one of the LTI configured tools. 

**Note** Many LMS activities can use the same EdEHR assignment. 

As a course designer you need to configure the EdEHR assignment. There are two ways to get to the Assignments page
1. click the assignment hyperlink in the activity description
2. or in the top navigation bar click the Assignments link

Option 1 takes you directly to the assignment you want. This is handy when there are a lot of assignments.

Next see [assignment](/course-designer/assignment.md)

> Can I see all my LMS courses and activities in the EdEHR

Yes but only those courses you have activated by clicking a link in the LMS. The EdEHR can not look into the LMS and discovery courses or activities you have access to. See [LTI](/shared/definitions.md#lti)
