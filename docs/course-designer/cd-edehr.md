# EdEHR setup for course designer

> Course designer configures the activity and assignment in the EdEHR

Prerequisites: a course designer has configured an activity in the LMS that links to the EdEHR. See [lms](/course-designer/cd-lms.md)

## Course activity listing
As a course designer (instructor or LMS administrator) you have clicked on an activity linked to the EdEHR.  You will be taken to the EdEHR dashboard.  The Dashboard shows all courses the user has activated by visiting the EdEHR via the LMS. Each course has a list of Activities. The Activity has a class list.  This shows the student users who have visited the EdEHR.  See [instructor](/instructor/) for more information about the Dashboard.

As a course designer notice:

> LMS description: 

> LMS configuration: assignment=ErinJonesCase1


The LMS description should show the activity description the LMS admin set when creating the LTI connection with the EdEHR. 

The LMS configuration shows the [External Id](/shared/definitions.md#external-id) set by the LMS admin into the LTI tool link. 


As a course designer you need to configure the EdEHR assignment.  There are two ways to get to the Assignments page
1. click the assignment link in the activity description
2. click the Assignments link in the top navigation bar.

Option 1 takes you directly to the assignment you want. This is handy when there are a lot of assignments.  

## Assignment Listing
![2]

The assignment listing shows you the assignment name (defaults to the LMS activity name), a description generated by the system, the [External Id](/shared/definitions.md#external-id), and the [Seed](/shared/definitions.md#seed) name.

At the bottom of the page is a checkbox.  This is prototype kludge that enables "content editing". Check this box to become a [course designer](/shared/definitions.md#edehr-course-designer). When you do the top of the page now has buttons that enable you to manage the assignments.
