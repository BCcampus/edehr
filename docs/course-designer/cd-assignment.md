# Working with assignments

The assignment list displays the assignment name (defaults to the LMS activity name), a description generated by the system, the [External Id](/shared/definitions.md#external-id), and the [Seed](/shared/definitions.md#seed) name.

**Note: Many LMS activities can use the same EdEHR assignment. In the future, each assignment list may contain a list of activities that use this assignment.**


## Editing an assignment description

This is what a newly activated EdEHR assignment looks like. The description is generated and the name is copied from the LMS activity. The External Id is shown for reference and the assignment is set to use the empty default [seed](/shared/definitions.md#seed) data.

At a minimum, it recommended that you change the description. Change the assignment name if you expect this assignment will be used again by another LMS activity. 

Select the seed you'd like to connect to the assignment from the dropdown. Normally you will also want to set up more than the default empty content. To do this you need to first create and edit a seed (see below). Then return to this screen and use the Edit button to change the seed. 

## Content development

At the bottom of the assignments page is a checkbox. This is a prototype kludge that enables "content editing". When this checkbox is ticked, buttons to manage assignments are displayed at the top of the page.

## Create a new assignment

Usually an assignment would be created from the LMS. It can also be created in the EdEHR first, and connected to by the LMS admin with the External Id by using this button.

## Download all assignments

This button downloads a file with all the assignment configuration data. This is just a prototype kludge to provide some means of doing a backup. There is no restore function but a EdEHR developer may be able to import the configuration if needed.

## Manage seed data

This button directs the user to the seed management page where they can create and manage seed data (course case study data). Once the seeds have been created, they can be linked to from the "Edit assignment description" dialog.
