# Configuring an activity in Moodle

### Prerequisites
Steps 1 to 3 in the [configuration docs](../configuration/#connect-moodle-to-the-edehr) have been completed by an LMS admin.

Navigate to the course. Select the gear icon and select "Turn editing on".

Click on "Add activity or resource"

Select "External tool" from the list

You can now set up the LTI link inside the course as an activity

Select the preconfigured tool your LMS admin created. Set the **Activity name**. It is recommended that you use the same name as the external tool. This name will appear in the course activities as well as in the EdEHR.

Click the "show more" link and add a description for the activity. This is the default description for the activity and can be added to within the EdEHR, but not removed. URL's will be shown to students as links when they view the description.
