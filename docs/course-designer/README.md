# A course designer's role

> Course designers create or find case studies relevant to the curriculum, put together an assignment based on that case study and create the seed that students will interact with when they login to the EdEHR to complete the respective assignment. They also connect the LMS to the EdEHR through an LTI connection.

This documentation was written with a focus on using Moodle for the LMS as that's what was chosen for the MVP milestone of the project.

We welcome [contributions to this documentation](../developer/contributors.html) for other LMS's.
