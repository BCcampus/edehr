    h1 Welcome to the Educational Electronic Health Record System (EdEHR)
    p.
      The Educational Electronic Health Record application is a
      <a target="_blank" href="https://bccampus.ca/">BCcampus</a>&nbsp;
      <a href="https://bccampus.github.io/edehr/developer/contributors.html">open-source</a>
      project funded by the Ministry of Advanced Education, Skills and Training.
      The EdEHR simulates the interaction a nurse, doctor, pharmacist or other medical practitioner would have using a professional EHR.
    p.
      A stakeholder group formed by individuals from from BCIT, Douglas College, UBC, and UVic helped to research
      and develop requirements that were used as a foundation for the project. The goal of that stakeholder group and
      this project was to build a pilot-ready, minimum viable product to give students access to an EHR system
      in classrooms before they work in a professional setting.
